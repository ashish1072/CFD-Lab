## Worksheet2: Arbitrary Geometries and Energy Transport for the Navier-Stokes Equations

* In the second part of the lab course, we extend our Navier-Stakes solver, such that it
can work on arbitrary domain geometries and apply various boundary conditions. 

* Afterwards, we will introduce an additional temperature equation to model energy transport.

* The extended program should read all physical and numerical parameters, together with
the boundary conditions, from a single input file problem.dat.

* The program should then be started by the command ‘./sim problem’
